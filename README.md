# **Purpose of the App**
Casas Robo Friends is a one-page application that allows users to search for the names of the robots without having to load the webpage again and thus saving resources.

## Using the App
There are two sections of the application the first is the search box on top of the webpage and right below are the display results from the search box which lists the cards that match the user's conditions. By default an empty search box returns all of the results, while the results of the cards changes with every added/removed letter within the search bar without overloading the application.
